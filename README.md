# MaintenancePro: Enterprise Maintenance Mode System

MaintenancePro is a professional-grade, enterprise-ready maintenance mode system for PHP applications. It is built on modern architectural principles, including SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and a clean, layered architecture. This system is designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to maintain, providing a seamless experience for both developers and end-users.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built upon a layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes a clean, maintainable codebase.

*   **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic, including entities, value objects, and domain events.
*   **Application Layer:** Orchestrates the application's use cases and business logic, including services and event dispatching.
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** Implements external concerns such as caching, logging, and database persistence.
*   **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction, including web (HTTP) and command-line (CLI) interfaces.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Adaptive Caching:** A two-layer cache system with a high-speed, in-memory cache for single-request performance, backed by a persistent file cache.
*   **Telemetry and Metrics:** A comprehensive metrics service that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), including cache hit/miss rates, request times, and security events.
*   **Intelligent Maintenance Strategy:** An adaptive strategy that can automatically suggest or enable maintenance mode based on real-time traffic patterns.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Services are loaded on-demand, ensuring optimal performance by only instantiating what is needed.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A full-featured CLI for managing maintenance mode, whitelisting IPs, and generating performance reports.
*   **SOLID and DDD Principles:** Built on a foundation of modern software design principles for a robust, maintainable, and scalable application.

## üöÄ Usage

### Web

To integrate MaintenancePro into your web application, include the following at the beginning of your `public/index.php`:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use MaintenancePro\Application\Kernel;

$app = new Kernel(dirname(__DIR__));
$app->run();
```

If maintenance mode is active, the system will automatically display the maintenance page and halt further execution.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides a set of commands for managing the maintenance mode system.

**Enable Maintenance Mode:**
```bash
php bin/console enable "Performing a database upgrade" 3600
```

**Disable Maintenance Mode:**
```bash
php bin/console disable
```

**Check Status:**
```bash
php bin/console status
```

**Whitelist an IP Address:**
```bash
php bin/console whitelist:add 192.168.1.100
```

**Generate a Performance Report:**
```bash
php bin/console metrics:report
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application's configuration is located in `config/config.json`. Here, you can customize settings for maintenance mode, security, and access control. To use the `IntelligentMaintenanceStrategy`, set the `maintenance.strategy` key to `"intelligent"`.

# MaintenancePro: Developer Checklist and Best Practices

This document provides a checklist for developers to follow when contributing to the MaintenancePro project. It also outlines the project's coding standards and best practices.

## 1. Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure you have completed the following:

- [ ] **Code is well-formatted:** Your code should adhere to the PSR-12 coding standard.
- [ ] **Tests are passing:** You have run the test suite and all tests are passing.
- [ ] **New tests have been added:** You have added new tests to cover any new features or bug fixes.
- [ ] **Documentation has been updated:** You have updated the documentation to reflect any changes to the API or architecture.
- [ ] **Pull request has a clear title and description:** Your pull request should have a clear and descriptive title and description, explaining the purpose of the changes.

## 2. New Feature Checklist

When developing a new feature, please consider the following:

- [ ] **Is the feature well-defined?** Have you clearly defined the scope and requirements of the feature?
- [ ] **Does the feature align with the project's vision?** Does the feature fit into the long-term roadmap for the project?
- [ ] **Is the feature secure?** Have you considered the security implications of the feature?
- [ ] **Is the feature performant?** Have you considered the performance implications of the feature?
- [ ] **Is the feature extensible?** Have you designed the feature in a way that allows for future extensions and modifications?

## 3. Coding Standards

The project follows the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standard. Please ensure your code adheres to this standard before submitting a pull request. You can use a tool like [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to automatically format your code.

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1. Keep It SOLID

The project is built on the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Please ensure your code adheres to these principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### 4.2. Write Clean Code

- **Keep it simple:** Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
- **Use meaningful names:** Use descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes.
- **Avoid magic numbers:** Use named constants instead of magic numbers.
- **Write comments where necessary:** Write comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.

### 4.3. Test Everything

- **Write unit tests:** Write unit tests for all new code.
- **Write integration tests:** Write integration tests to ensure that the different components of the application work together correctly.
- **Write functional tests:** Write functional tests to ensure that the application meets the user's requirements.

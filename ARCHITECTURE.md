# MaintenancePro v6.0: Architectural Overview

## 1. Introduction

MaintenancePro is a professional-grade, enterprise-ready maintenance mode system for PHP applications. It is built on modern architectural principles, including SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and a clean, layered architecture. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, design patterns, and key components.

## 2. Layered Architecture

The application is divided into four distinct layers, each with its own set of responsibilities. This separation of concerns makes the application more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

### 2.1. Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer is responsible for handling user interaction and displaying information. It includes controllers, views, and templates. This layer should not contain any business logic; its sole purpose is to format and present data to the user.

- **Location:** `src/Presentation/`
- **Key Components:** `AdminController`, `Router`, `TemplateRenderer`

### 2.2. Application Layer

The Application Layer contains the application's use cases and orchestrates the business logic. It acts as a bridge between the Presentation Layer and the Domain Layer. This layer is responsible for handling application-specific tasks, such as managing services, dispatching events, and coordinating with the infrastructure.

- **Location:** `src/Application/`
- **Key Components:** `Kernel`, `ServiceContainer`, `EventDispatcher`

### 2.3. Domain Layer

The Domain Layer is the heart of the application. It contains the core business logic, entities, and value objects. This layer is independent of any specific framework or infrastructure, making it highly reusable and testable.

- **Location:** `src/Domain/`
- **Key Components:** `Maintenance`, `Whitelist`, `MaintenanceStrategy`

### 2.4. Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides the technical implementation of the application's services. It includes concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the Domain Layer, such as database repositories, caching services, and logging.

- **Location:** `src/Infrastructure/`
- **Key Components:** `JsonConfiguration`, `AdaptiveCache`, `MonologLogger`

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1. Kernel

The `Kernel` is the central component of the application. It is responsible for:
- Bootstrapping the application.
- Registering service providers.
- Handling incoming requests and dispatching them to the appropriate controllers.

### 3.2. ServiceContainer

The `ServiceContainer` is a powerful dependency injection container that manages the application's services. It supports:
- Service registration and resolution.
- Singleton and factory services.
- `\ArrayAccess` for convenient, array-like syntax.

### 3.3. EventDispatcher

The `EventDispatcher` implements the Observer pattern, allowing for a decoupled and extensible architecture. It is used to dispatch events throughout the application, enabling different components to react to changes without being tightly coupled.

## 4. Design Patterns

The application leverages several well-known design patterns to achieve a clean, modular, and maintainable architecture.

- **Service Locator:** The `ServiceContainer` acts as a service locator, providing a central point of access for all application services.
- **Dependency Injection:** Services are injected into their dependencies through the `ServiceContainer`, promoting loose coupling and testability.
- **Strategy Pattern:** The `MaintenanceStrategy` interface allows for different maintenance mode strategies to be implemented and swapped out at runtime.
- **Observer Pattern:** The `EventDispatcher` allows for a decoupled architecture where components can subscribe to and react to events without being tightly coupled.
- **Decorator Pattern:** The `AdaptiveCache` decorates the `FileCache`, adding an in-memory caching layer to improve performance.
- **Repository Pattern:** The application uses repositories to abstract the data layer, allowing for different storage mechanisms to be used without affecting the business logic.

## 5. Directory Structure

The project's directory structure is organized to reflect the layered architecture and promote a clear separation of concerns.

- **`bin/`:** Contains the command-line entry point (`console`).
- **`config/`:** Contains the application's configuration files.
- **`public/`:** Contains the web entry point (`index.php`) and any public assets.
- **`src/`:** Contains the application's source code, organized by layer.
  - **`Application/`:** The Application Layer.
  - **`Domain/`:** The Domain Layer.
  - **`Infrastructure/`:** The Infrastructure Layer.
  - **`Presentation/`:** The Presentation Layer.
- **`templates/`:** Contains the application's view templates.
- **`tests/`:** Contains the application's test suite, with separate directories for unit, integration, and functional tests.
- **`var/`:** Contains volatile data, such as cache, logs, and storage.
